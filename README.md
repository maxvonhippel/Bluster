Bluster was a surprisingly popular weather app I made in high school built upon the SolÂº open-source wunderground project.  The app was featured on the Turkey App Store under *20 Under 20* (I was indeed under 20 at the time) and has garnered a few thousand downloads.

I am now re-building bluster from scratch.  This repository represents my efforts to that effect.

Any code not pertaining to graphics or design is free for anyone to use for any purpose.  Anything else (graphics, text files, oo3 files, etc.) are not availble for commercial use, and if used non-commercially, must include some sort of attribution.  The app icon is not available for any use, commercial or otherwise.  Note that I have not yet begun work on the UI - much of the app works, but it's all happening in the background.  UI stuff is in the works and will be added eventually.

Enjoy!
